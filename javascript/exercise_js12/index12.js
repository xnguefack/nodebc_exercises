//Define a firstname variable and assign your name (string)
let FirstName = "HervÃ©"
    //Define a greeting variable and assign the following value: Welcome
let greeting = "Welcome"
    //Use console.log() to show the message Welcome and your name, Concat both variables to get the final message
console.log(greeting + " " + FirstName) // "" -> to create a space in between variable values while concatening
