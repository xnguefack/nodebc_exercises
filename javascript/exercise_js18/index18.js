//Create a new index18.js file
//Define a new variable with the name store and assign the value: Gianu's

    //Use console.log() to output the following message using string concatenation: Gianu's it's the best store
console.log("1. ", storeName + " " + sentenceEnd)
console.log("2. ", `${storeName} ${sentenceEnd}`) //also work directly instead of declaring first a variable with template literal
